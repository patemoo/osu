1. How many cost units are spent in the entire process 
of performing 32 consecutive push operations on an empty array
which starts out at capacity 8, assuming that the array will double
in capacity each time a new item is added to an already full dynamic array?

8 + 9 + 7 + 17 + 7 + 25 + 7 = 80

80 cost units

AS N (ie. the number of pushes) grows large, under this strategy for resizing,
what is the big-oh complexity for a push?

O(1)+


2. How many cost units are spent in the entire process of performing
32 consecutive push operations on an empty array wich starts out at
capacity 8, assuming that the array will grow by a constant 2 spaces 
each time a new item is added to an already full dynamic array?

8 + 9 + 1 + 11 + 1 + 13 + 1 + 15 + 1 + 17 + 1 + 19 + 1 + 21 + 1 + 23 + 1 + 
25 + 1 + 27 + 1 + 29 + 1 + 31 + 1

260 cost units

As N (ie. the number of pushes) grows large, under this strategy for resizing, 
what is the big-oh complexity for a push?
